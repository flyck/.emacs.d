#+Title:   My use-package configuration in org-mode
#+Author:  Felix Brilej
#+STARTUP: showall

* Initialization
  I set some general CoLor variables with the prefix CL and i try to stick to these throughout
  this document whenever i redefine colors. I consider this my standard-library of "good colors"
  that i should use as my kind of color-palette when i go around and change defaults.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'use-package)
    ;; (setq debug-on-error t) (turn on if needed)
    (setq package-check-signature nil) ;; disables public key errors that i dont feel like investigating

* File-browsing and text-searching

** Recentf
  I hate browsing for files (I frequently use), this package is supposed to help me out with that
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package recentf
      ;; i think it's build-in anyways but I'll just throw config at this problem until it is resolved
      :ensure t
      :config
      ;; Quote: When using TrampMode with recentf.el, it’s advisable to turn off the cleanup feature
      ;; of recentf that attempts to stat all the files and remove them from the recently accessed
      ;; list if they are readable. Tramp means that this requires recentf to open up a remote site
      ;; which will block your emacs process at the most inopportune times.
      ;;
      (setq recentf-auto-cleanup 'never)
      (recentf-mode 1)
      (setq recentf-max-saved-items 0)
      ;; get rid of `find-file-read-only' and replace it with something more useful.
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-r") 'ido-recentf-open)
      (defun ido-recentf-open ()
        "Use `ido-completing-read' to \\[find-file] a recent file"
        (interactive)
        (if (find-file (ido-completing-read "Find recent file: " recentf-list))
            (message "Opening file...")
          (message "Aborting")))
      )
  #+END_SRC

** Helm
  A convenient interface to select about anything from a list: Browse files, select themes, show
  and select search-results and much more.

  Helm-mini is a revolution to navigating through buffers!
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm
  :ensure t
  :init
  (define-key global-map "\C-xb" 'helm-mini)
  :config
  (setq helm-mini-default-sources '(helm-source-buffers-list
				    helm-source-recentf
				    helm-source-bookmarks
				    helm-source-buffer-not-found))
  (helm-mode 1)
  (set-face-attribute 'helm-selection nil
                    :background cl-selection-background
                    :foreground cl-selection-foreground)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'helm-M-x)
  (define-key global-map "\C-c\C-s" 'helm-grep-do-git-grep)
  ;; automatically resize the search window based on results (feels convenient)
  ;; (helm-autoresize-mode 1) ;; currently disabled since i keep using track of it due to the resizing
  )
  #+END_SRC

  A package that helps searching for text within the current file. Each matching line gets listed
  in an overview which is really good. A downfall to this is that it cant be used for
  keyboard-macros, for these the standard isearch works way better.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package helm-swoop
      :ensure t
      :config
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'helm-swoop-without-pre-input)
      )
  #+END_SRC

** Finding files
   As great as helm is, there is an even better file-finding package, however it hinders me from
   remote file editing, for which i then manually have to call "find-file", which is an inconvenience.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package counsel
  :ensure t
  :config
  (require 'swiper)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-f") 'counsel-find-file)
  )
   #+END_SRC

*** TODO Make this more convenient
    Ideas:
    - Try the helm function again with better customization so it is convenient
    - Customize this open more so it does enable me to edit remote-files

** Searching for strings                                      :sysenv:
  Deft searches for strings in my org-files, at work this takes forever to load though, so it is
  not a core part of my workflow. I might have to adapt to only search through text-files.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; documentation over here: http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/
(use-package deft
  :if (cond ((equal "home" (getenv "SYSENV")) (message "Loading magit"))
            ((equal "laptop" (getenv "SYSENV")) (message "Loading magit"))
            ((equal "work" (getenv "SYSENV")) (message "Loading magit"))
            )
  :config
  (setq deft-extensions '("txt" "tex" "org"))
  (if (equal "work" (getenv "SYSENV"))
      (progn (setq deft-directory (concat "C:\\Users\\" (getenv "USERNAME") "\\Desktop\\Projekte")))
      )
  (if (or (equal "home" (getenv "SYSENV"))
          (equal "laptop" (getenv "SYSENV")))
      (progn (setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/org"))
    )
  (setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/org")
  (setq deft-recursive t)
  (setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)
  )
  #+END_SRC

  This package searches for strings in the current textfile very conveniently since it gives you
  a quick overview over *all* of the search-results.
  This package however frequently breaks on windows, such that suddenly i can only scroll down in
  the result-list. Reinstalling the package fixes that, however that is a huge inconvenience.
  After reinstalling this package can break just by searching for "magit" in this file. That's it,
  I'm suspending this package.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; (use-package swiper-helm
    ;;   :ensure t
    ;;   :config
    ;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'swiper-helm)
    ;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c u") 'swiper-all)
    ;;   )
  #+END_SRC

** Open the explorer
   To open the OS-specific file-browser either use this command: =M-! explorer .= or the following
   code snippet:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (defun browse-current-folder ()
     "open the current buffer’s folder"
     (interactive)
     (browse-url (concat "file://" (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))))
   )
   (global-set-key [M-f9] 'browse-current-folder)
   #+END_SRC

* Conveniences

** Undo-tree
   Undo-tree provides a graphical representation of recent changes made to the file. When I first
   starting to use it it felt terrible, since a whole new window opens every time i call it. With
   time it has proven to be very helpful though.

   This package is best used selectively, when i just want to undo something I use ~M-S-_~, when I
   am not sure what just happened (maybe I deleted text on accident) I'll definately use ~C-x u~ and
   go through the last couple of iterations.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package undo-tree
  :ensure t
  :config
  (global-undo-tree-mode)
  )
   #+END_SRC

** Which-key
   My guide for shortcuts i forget in part and for exploring options after already having pressed
   parts of a key-combination.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(use-package which-key
  :ensure t
  :config
  (which-key-setup-side-window-right)
  (setq which-key-popup-type 'side-window)
  (which-key-mode)
  :defer 5
  )
    #+END_SRC

** Immortal-scratch
   Respawns the scratch buffer when its killed, feels just right
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package immortal-scratch
  :ensure t
  :config
  (immortal-scratch-mode t)
  )
   #+END_SRC

** Yasnippet
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; Currently there is a problem "package does not untar cleanly"
     (use-package yasnippet
       :ensure t
       :init
       (define-key global-map "\C-cy" 'yas/insert-snippet)
       ;;(setq yas-snippet-dirs (append yas-snippet-dirs
       ;;"~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-20150912.1330/snippets/"))
       :config
       (yas-global-mode 1)
       :defer 5
     )
   #+END_SRC

** Beginend
   Beginend is a package that is supposed to improve on the navigation to the beginning and end of
   buffer, depending on the mode of course.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package beginend
       :ensure t
       :config
       (beginend-global-mode)
       )
   #+END_SRC

** Hydras
   Code to easily, incrementally adjust the transparency settings:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package hydra
       :ensure t
       )

     (defun my--set-transparency (inc)
       "Increase or decrease the selected frame transparency"
       (let* ((alpha (frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha))
              (next-alpha (cond ((not alpha) 100)
                                ((> (- alpha inc) 100) 100)
                                ((< (- alpha inc) 0) 0)
                                (t (- alpha inc)))))
         (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha next-alpha)))

     (defhydra hydra-transparency (:columns 2)
       "
       ALPHA : [ %(frame-parameter nil 'alpha) ]
       "
       ("j" (lambda () (interactive) (my--set-transparency +1)) "+ more")
       ("k" (lambda () (interactive) (my--set-transparency -1)) "- less")
       ("J" (lambda () (interactive) (my--set-transparency +10)) "++ more")
       ("K" (lambda () (interactive) (my--set-transparency -10)) "-- less")
       ("=" (lambda (value) (interactive "nTransparency Value 0 - 100 opaque:")
              (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha value)) "Set to ?" :color blue))
   #+END_SRC

** Smooth-scrolling
   This mode doesnt have a good interaction with C-l which centers the current line in the buffer
   to the middle, top and bottom. Using C-l to put the current line to the top of the buffer and
   then pressing UP results in an unpleasant shift of the buffer position. However for simple
   scrolling this is nice.

   This mode also makes next-line and previous-line so slow that it is uncomfortable to use.

   However scrolling is nice with this, lol. I have it disabled right now for its disadvantages
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(use-package smooth-scrolling
  :ensure t
  :init
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (smooth-scrolling-mode 1)))
  )
   #+END_SRC

** Smartparens
   This package is sometimes not so smart, sometimes it inserts parenthesis when i dont want them,
   especially in org-mode. I need to customize this more.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; smartparens, a mode that tries to be smart around parentheses of all kinds
(use-package smartparens
  :ensure t
  :init
  (smartparens-global-mode t)
  ;; make the overlay disappear

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package writeroom-mode
   :ensure t
   :config
   (setq writeroom-width 100)
   )
   #+END_SRC

** Rainbow delimiters
   This package is kind of a useless extension since the colors it uses are way too subtle
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package rainbow-delimiters
  :ensure t
  :init
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
  )

   Prerequisite on ubuntu is the following
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no :results silent
   sudo apt-get install aspell-de
   #+END_SRC

   I dont use this hook right now since it slow editing down a bit and correct spelling is
   actually not that crucial. Also writing german and english in the same document seems confusing
   for flyspell (as for every / most grammar correction programms).
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (if (equal "laptop" (getenv "SYSENV"))
         (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-flyspell)
     )
   #+END_SRC

   I dont load this package on systems where i dont have the "SYSENV" environment variable

*** Define emacs shutdown function (taken from baron42bba)
    Emacs is a powerful tool, so powerfull that i need to protect myself from deleting huge
    chunks of my org-files on accident without noticing. I can do this by committing after each

*** Org-mode agenda custom views                              :sysenv:
    This agenda assumes that i have the following structure somewhere in my org-file:
    - Projects
      - Life-Goals
        - 1-month-goals :month1:
          - Professional :prof:
          - Private      :priv:
        - 1-year-goals :year1:
          - Professional
          - Private
        - 5-year-goals :year5:
          - Professional
          - Private

    This then gets inserted nicely into the agenda:
    - monthy professional goals
    - monthy private goals
    - agenda
    - 1-year goals
    - 5-year goals

    I do this to not lose track of the big picture while doing day-to-day tasks. This is an idea
    from the book "Time Management for System Administrators" by Thomas A. Limoncelli. He advices
    to include your long-term goal as a page in your personal planner so you can look at it from
    time to time.

    The todo-filter (+TODO<>\"\") makes it so that only the goals are visible, the headlines -
    which also match the tag-search this is based on - get excluded from the results which is
    convenient.

**** Minted, coloured source-blocks in latex

     pygmentize to be in path:

     In my case i had to delete the temporary folder in the same directory to make the coloring

**** Org-mode alert extension
    This is a package on top of the original =alert.el=

    Im pretty sure this makes my "fbr/tea-timer" possible which is defined somewhere else. This way
    i can basically remind myself to not spend too much time on a task by setting a timer
    before-hand. This can also be done similarly with "C-c C-x C-e" after clocking into a task. This way an
    expected time-consumption can be set and the timer gets red once we exceed this time, which is
    not as convenient as having an extra alert-window in my oppinion.

    Go through this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3844/good-methods-for-setting-up-alarms-audio-visual-triggered-by-org-mode-events

*** Tramp fixes
    From Howards Blog: http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html this is
    supposed to overwrite the standard org-mode function in ~ob-core.el~ which is buggy and can
    completely block the org-babel functionality on windows.

    On windows the faulty file is here: <path_to_emacs>\emacs\share\emacs\24.5\lisp\org

    Github pages ~cn~ are really an optimal way for org-mode nerds to blog. We usually have a github
    account anyway to manage our 1000+ commits big emacs config accross multiple devices, and we
    have learned enough about emacs to dish out some knowledge through our own blog.

    How can you blog comfortably in this setup? Let's get started...

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <!--more-->
    #+END_EXPORT

    Steps:
    - Create a directory where I want the blog to be, in my case =~/Dropbox/org/blog=
    - Follow the steps from here: http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-blog-from-org-to-hugo/
    - Install hugo (on Windows 10)
      1. Install chocolatey https://chocolatey.org/install#install-with-cmdexe
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
         # for the powershell, close it after execution
         Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
         #+END_SRC
      2. Install hugo using chocolatey:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
         # on the normal shell
         choco install hugo -confirm
         #+END_SRC
    - Follow the startup steps for hugo to setup a site and get the server running
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
      # some command to create a default site from the tutorial
      # then download a theme
      # copy the exampleSite structure from the theme directoy into the main blog directory to have some dummy content
      # - usually this dummy content also explains the theme capabilities
      cp -R theme/$theme_name/exampleSite .
      hugo server
      # look at the site
      #+END_SRC
    - Create a github.io repository and connect it to the directory
      - Create the github repository
        - Navigate to your github account and create this repo: username.github.io
      - Create the local repository
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
        cd ~/Dropbox/org/blog
        git init
        git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
        #+END_SRC
    - Further steps:
      - [ ] https://gohugo.io/themes/customizing/ Check out the customizing tutorial
      - [ ] Settle on a theme
        - I tried out ananke, a default theme
        - I tried out "bluestnight". Now i have to customize it.
          - Disabled the patreon widget
        - I tried out beautifulhugo

    Creating a new blog post using the previously describe setup should be easy and
    comfortable. These are the generic steps for adding a blog-post.

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <!--more-->
    #+END_EXPORT

    1) *Create the content in org-mode*: Open any org-file on the computer and write a blogpost.
       - Any existing org-mode heading could be turned into a blogpost, but most generic notes
         dont make for a good blog post. Some of them can be a good basis though.
    2) *Tag it so i can find it again later*: Tag it with “blog” so I can find it through the
       agenda. Enables me to list how much time i spend blogging in a week / month / year.
    3) *Create hugo variable placeholders*: Navigate to the headline and press =M-x hugo=
    4) *Fill in the hugo variables*. An example is below:
       #+BEGIN_SRC org
         :PROPERTIES:
         :TITLE:    Setting up the blog
         :HUGO_TAGS: emacs blogging
         :HUGO_TOPICS: emacs
         :HUGO_FILE: setting_up_the_blog.md
         :HUGO_DATE: [2017-08-15 Di 22:14]
         :END:
       #+END_SRC
       - It is hidden in an org-mode drawer which makes it easy to hide
    5) *Convert the headline into a markdown file according to the hugo variables*: Navigate to the
       headline and press =M-x hugo=
    6) *Regenerate the website including the new markdown file*: Open a shell (I use git bash on
       Windows), navigate to the blog directory and execute =hugo=
       - Optional: Debugging, check the blog post formatting before uploading it
       - For this execute “hugo server” and navigate to the local blog
       - Downside: pictures dont get resolved correctly
    7) *Publish the website*
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       cd public
       git add * && git commit -m "site update" && git push origin master
       #+END_SRC

** SQL
   Thanks to baron42bba and https://truongtx.me/2014/08/23/setup-emacs-as-an-sql-database-client
   I yet have to actually test this config.

   Also check:
   - https://github.com/Trevoke/sqlup-mode.el
     - a presumably nice mode for writing sql

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
   ;; truncate lines such that tables with many columns dont line-wrap
   (add-hook 'sql-interactive-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (toggle-truncate-lines t)))

   (defun my-sql-connect ()
     (interactive)
     (require 'my-password "~/.emacs_secrets.el.gpg")
     (setq sql-product 'mysql)

     (let ((connection (helm-comp-read
                        "Select server: "
                        my-sql-servers-alist
                        )))
       (sql-connect connection))
     (sql-rename-buffer)
     )
   #+END_SRC

   your =~/.emacs_secrets.el.gpg= might look like:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
   (setq my-sql-servers-alist
         '("serverA" "serverB"))

   (setq sql-connection-alist
         '((bbaprd (sql-product 'mysql)
                   (sql-server "host42.foo.com")
                   (sql-user "dbadmin")
                   (sql-password "foo")
                   (sql-database "serverA"))
           (bbatst (sql-product 'mysql)
                   (sql-server "host42.foo.com")
                   (sql-user "dbadmin")
                   (sql-password "foo")
                   (sql-database "serverB"))
           ))

   (provide 'my-password)

* Programming
  I rarely use emacs as an IDE, so this is not a rich section.

** C Lang                                                     :sysenv:
  The main thing i use from the following is the "jump to definition" function, which is otherwise
  a tedious manual task.

  I only have this activated on my laptop since it uses the external tool ggtags.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-gtags
  :if (equal "laptop" (getenv "SYSENV"))
  :config
  ;; Enable helm-gtags-mode
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'helm-gtags-mode)
  (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'helm-gtags-mode)
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'helm-gtags-mode)
  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'helm-gtags-mode)
  (add-hook 'asm-mode-hook 'helm-gtags-mode)

  (define-key helm-gtags-mode-map (kbd "C-c g a") 'helm-gtags-tags-in-this-function)
  (define-key helm-gtags-mode-map (kbd "C-j") 'helm-gtags-select)
  (define-key helm-gtags-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'helm-gtags-dwim)
  (define-key helm-gtags-mode-map (kbd "M-,") 'helm-gtags-pop-stack)
  (define-key helm-gtags-mode-map (kbd "C-c <") 'helm-gtags-previous-history)
  (define-key helm-gtags-mode-map (kbd "C-c >") 'helm-gtags-next-history)

  (setq-local imenu-create-index-function #'ggtags-build-imenu-index)
  )
  #+END_SRC

* Themes
  This section should be at the end, since some of the modes come with their own color-settings
  and these are supposed to be overwritten by the theme-config, the theme-config should have the
  final say in coloring, so I can appreciate the themes in all their beauty.

  Themes usually dont touch the helm-interface, for that there is a package called "helm-themes"
  and it usually makes sense to load the helm-theme along with the "main" theme.

** Seti theme
   I used this theme for a long time and it is pretty good, but sometimes i have to mix it up!
   Care for the workaround though!
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent :tangle no

   Manually uncommented "mode-line" settings of this theme in the package itself for now.

*** Seti-theme workaround
    I had to uncomment two lines in the official package for this theme. If i dont do so the
    html-export breaks.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results drawer :tangle no
    # Here are the two lines
    grep "breaks" ~/.emacs.d/elpa/seti-theme-20161208.836/seti-theme.el
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :RESULTS:
       ;; `(font-lock-comment-delimiter-face ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face))))) ;;disabled because it breaks the html-export
       ;; `(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground ,text-3)))) ;;disabled because it breaks the html-export
    :END:

    Apart from that i now (<2017-04-13 Do>) get an error that the face "bold" does not exist. A
    bunch of settings in the theme inherit from this face. I guess i have to fix this or use a
    different theme.

** Eziam theme
   This is a new-comer, the grayscaling really is a new take on themes for me and the
   source-blocks look much nicer. However headlines in org-mode are really chunky and I'm not used
   to that yet.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent :tangle no
     (use-package eziam-theme
       :if (equal "laptop" (getenv "SYSENV"))
       :init

       ;; (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/eziam-emacs-theme")
       (load-theme 'eziam-light t)
       )
   #+END_SRC

   For installation execute the following:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir ~/.emacs.d/themes :results silent :tangle no
     rm -rf eziam-theme-emacs #makes sure the directory is clean
     git clone https://github.com/thblt/eziam-theme-emacs.git
   #+END_SRC

** zenburn theme

** Cyperpunk theme
   Awesome theme with flashy colors. Something nice to come back to after having tried all sorts

** Monokai +gnome madness
   Installed packages ontop of gnome:
   - Inspired by: https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/5pk5p1/gala_with_emacs_made_pretty/
   - https://github.com/optimisme/gnome-shell-simple-dock
     - installable using a simple click in the browser
   - https://github.com/andreisergiu98/arc-flatabulous-theme
     - has to be installed manually
     - commands that helped me on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS that uses lightdm by default:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
       apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop gnome-shell gdm
       dpkg-reconfigure gdm/lightdm
       #+END_SRC
   - https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (use-package monokai-theme
       :ensure t
       :config
       (load-theme 'monokai t)
       (set-background-color "#2f343f")
       )
   #+END_SRC

** Spacemacs theme
   Taken from: http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/get-that-spacemacs-look-without-spacemacs/
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  :ensure t
  :init
  (load-theme 'spacemacs-light t)
  (setq spacemacs-theme-org-agenda-height nil)
  (setq spacemacs-theme-org-height nil)
)
   #+END_SRC

   This contains a couple of options to stop the theme using variable heights for org-mode agenda
   items and headings. However, they didn’t have the desired effect for me to I also needed to add
   the following lines to my org-mode configuration:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; set sizes here to stop spacemacs theme resizing these
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :height 1.0)
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-2 nil :height 1.0)

** Purple-haze theme
   This theme is great, some of the monitors i use however dont display the slight
   color-differences between the different tones of purple nicely, such that it just looks
   black. Playing with the monitor-settings sadly doesnt resolve this, this might not be my final
   theme. "Final theme".. *smirk*

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (use-package purple-haze-theme
       :ensure t
       :config
       (load-theme 'purple-haze t)

* The cursor style
  Set this after the themes since some themes reset this.

  Currently untangled since the cursor seems to adapt the text color which makes it hard to spot
  at times.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
    (set-default 'cursor-type 'bar)
    (set-cursor-color "#000000")
  #+END_SRC

* Modeline
  I never learned how to successfully edit the modeline yet, i just keep copying configs from nice
  screenshots which then only work in part so i have to delete them again lol. Some themes come
  with okay modeline configurations.

  I Load it after the theme since themes sometimes set their own mode-line.

  Former problem: use-package doesnt find spaceline-config or spaceline, doest this still exist?

** Spaceline config
